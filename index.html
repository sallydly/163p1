  <h2 class=vquestion> Question:  Is there a correlation between age and crimes committed? Are more teens caught for their crimes or are adults more likely to be caught for their crimes? Who are more likely to be victims? </h2>

  <h1 class=vtitle> Visualization #2 </h2>
  <h2 class=vquestion> Question: Is there a relationship between the amount of crime that occurs/is recorded and the time of the year? Also, does the number of males and females involved in crime fluctuate with the time of year as well? </h2>
  <div id=vis2> </div>
  
  <div class=caption> 
  <p> <u> Caption: </u>This stacked bar graph shows the total number of recorded crimes during each month of 2014. Each month's data is split between three categories: male, female, and unknown/unrecorded persons who were involved in a crime in one way or another. </p> 
  </div>
  
  <p> <u> Analysis: </u> I thought it would be a good idea to ask a question that looked at all the data points rather than just a subset. Since it was data for only the 2014 year, it made it easy to visualize the number of crimes recorded per month. I wanted to know if crimes rose during the fall or winter where days are shorter and nights are longer. My assumption was that crimes occured more often at night. For the gender question, it's become common for women to fear going out at night so I wanted to know if crimes involving women would increase during the year with longer nights. </p>
  <p> However, the amount of unrecorded genders make my conclusions from the visualization a bit questionable. From what we have, my assumptions were incorrect and not only were less women involved in crimes during the fall/winter, the total number of recorded crimes overall lowered during these cold months. The peak of crime was during the spring or summer. </p>

  <h1 class=vtitle> Visualization #3 </h1>
  <h2 class=vquestion> Question: Are there differences between the types of crimes commited by men or women? </h2>
  
  <div id=vis3> 
  <form>
  <label> <input type="radio" name="dataset" id="dataset" value="total" checked> Total </label>
  <label> <input type="radio" name="dataset" id="dataset" value="male"> Men </label>
  <label> <input type="radio" name="dataset" id="dataset" value="female"> Women </label>
  </form>
  </div>
  
  <div class=caption>
  <p> <u> Caption: </u> This donut chart shows the percentages of the most "popular" crimes committed by the found culprit. You can choose between "Total", "Men", and "Women" to see differences between what crimes each gender is more likely to commit. </p>
  </div>
  
  <p> <u> Analysis: </u> In the first visualization, it was an obvious point that more (known) men commited crimes than women did in the year 2014. I wanted to take it a step further and wanted to know what crimes men and women commited. Was there a big difference? Was there a crime that men were more like to commit and vice versa. I took a subset of the dataset and picked out the most popular crimes (more than ~1000 recorded incidents) with known culprits. I used a pie chart since it would be easiest to see what was most "popular". I also made it interactive so users can see the difference between "Men" and "Women" through motion rather than comparing pie charts side by side. Some interesting insignts is that assault was a common crime for both genders (contrary to popular belief that mainly men are abusers) and theft is a VERY common crime among women compared to men. </p>
